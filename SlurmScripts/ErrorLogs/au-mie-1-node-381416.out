Using MPI version 3.1, 64 processes
Medium should be stable according to frequency and resolution criteria.
All resonant frequencies are small enough for this resolution.
Medium could be unstable according to dimensions and index criteria.
Maximum Courant factor should be 0.20893145279749673
As a whole, the simulation could not be stable
Recommended maximum courant factor is 0.20893145279749673
